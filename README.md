# DigitalTwinForAircraftMaintenance
Digital Twin MAS architecture for applications in maintenance 
Project Goal: Develop a digital twin architecture using a multi-agent system and AI for smart maintenance of aircraft distribution systems.

Objective: Build a reliable model that accurately represents the real system in an offline environment.

Methodology :Â 

Developed a simulation based on an aircraft distribution system model, mimicking real system behavior.
Created a dataset with four runs, five scenarios per run, and five operating points per scenario.
Simulated healthy and faulty conditions using MATLAB-injected faults across various categories.
Focused on four system components: hydraulic pump, tanks, engines, and pumps.
Generated data for 11 healthy and faulty scenarios, including six fault types:
Noise on instruments
Abnormal instrument readings
Minor service problems
External leakage
Parameter deviation
Structural deficiency
Features used for analysis:
Pump flow for pumps
Pump motor speed for hydraulic pumps
Driver power
Tank volume and temperature

Expected Results:

Compare performance of different asset health estimation models.
Develop new predictive maintenance strategies.
Predict and emulate complex aircraft behavior through multi-agent systems and AI.
